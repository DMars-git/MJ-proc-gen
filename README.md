# MJ-proc-gen
A procedural generation project inspired by Markov Junior, by mxgmn. I created this to explore and learn how MJ works, and to see if I can re-create it. I provided a Grasshopper file which can run it, though this program is not specifically intended for Grasshopper or Rhino, it should be implementable in any 3d software.
